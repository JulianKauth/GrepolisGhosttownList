# GrepolisGhosttownList
List the ghost towns for a server in grepolis

# Python

The `GhosttownList.py` file uses `model/Database.py` and `model/Fetcher.py` to display a simple list of Ghost Towns in around the map center.

# Rust

TODO, but I intend to build a simple, standalone GUI Application that does the same, but can be distributed more easily than the python code.
