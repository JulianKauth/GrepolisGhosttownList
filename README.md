# GrepolisGhosttownList
List the ghost towns for a server in grepolis

## Run

To run, execute `__main__.py` or `presenter.py` i.e. `python3 presenter.py`

The server input field expects the id in the form \<countrycode\>\<servernumber\>, e.g. `de99`. The max distance restricts the selection to a circle around the center at 500/500. It expects a number, e.g. `200`.

## Dependencies

The code requires `PyQt6` and `requests`, which can be installed with `pip3 install PyQt6 requests`
