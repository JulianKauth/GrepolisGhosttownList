This program should provide a way to load world data and display cities on a map, similar to grepolismaps.org. I want to be able to filter the displayed cities by alliance, player, player points, and ghost cities. The data is probably best served in an ad hoc sqlite database, so the model/data/ directory is probably not gonna be used, but we will see.
